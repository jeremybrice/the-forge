## Relay — session handoff (L2)
When the user signals the session is wrapping up ("done for today", "let's
continue tomorrow", or a task completes and we're winding down), run
`/session-save` to persist a Relay handoff. If unsure the session is ending,
offer it in one line.
At wrap-up, also capture durable facts/lessons with `/relay-learn` (or inline
`knowledge add`), and surface any graduation-ready lesson for the user to approve.
